Explanation of the Code:
This is a basic HTML template for a React application. It serves as the entry point for rendering the application in the browser. Below is a breakdown of its components and functionality:

Key Elements:
<meta charset="UTF-8" />
Specifies the character encoding for the document.
Ensures that special characters (e.g., emojis, accented letters) are displayed correctly.
<link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/vite.svg" />
Defines the favicon (icon displayed in the browser tab).
The href points to an SVG file (/vite.svg), which is commonly used in Vite-based projects.
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
Ensures the page is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
width=device-width sets the viewport width to the device's screen width.
initial-scale=1.0 ensures the page is displayed at a 1:1 scale without zooming.
<title>Garden Gateway</title>
Sets the title of the webpage, which appears in the browser tab.
In this case, the title is "Garden Gateway."
<div id="root"></div>
Acts as the root DOM element where the React application will be mounted.
The React app renders its components inside this <div>.
<script type="module" src="/src/main.jsx"></script>
Loads the main JavaScript module (main.jsx) for the React application.
The type="module" attribute enables ES6 module syntax, allowing modern JavaScript features like import and export.
How It Works:
HTML Structure:
The HTML file provides the basic structure of the webpage.
It includes metadata (e.g., character encoding, viewport settings) and links to external resources (e.g., favicon).
React Integration:
The <div id="root"></div> serves as the container for the React application.
The <script> tag loads the React app from /src/main.jsx, which initializes and renders the application into the #root element.
Responsive Design:
The <meta name="viewport"> tag ensures the application looks good on all devices, including mobile phones and tablets.
Development Workflow:
This template is commonly used in modern React applications built with tools like Vite or Create React App.
During development, changes to the React code are automatically reflected in the browser thanks to hot module replacement (HMR).
Usage:
This HTML file is typically used as the starting point for a React application. It:

Serves as the entry point for rendering the React app.
Provides essential metadata and configuration for the webpage.
Ensures compatibility with modern web standards and responsive design principles.
To use this template:

Place it in the public or root directory of your project.
Ensure the src/main.jsx file contains the React application logic.
Run the development server (e.g., using npm run dev or yarn dev) to start the app -->
