// This file defines a layout component called `ShoppingLayout` which serves as a wrapper for all the pages in a shopping application.
// It provides a consistent structure across different pages, including a header, main content area (via `Outlet`), and footer.
// The layout also includes a dark overlay and a background image to enhance the visual design of the application.

        Explanation:
        - `relative`: Makes the container a positioning context for child elements.
        - `flex flex-col`: Arranges child elements in a vertical column.
        - `overflow-hidden`: Prevents content from overflowing the container.
        - `w-screen`: Ensures the container spans the full width of the screen.
        - `bg-bg-image bg-cover bg-center bg-repeat`: Applies a background image that covers the entire container, centers it, and repeats if necessary.

        Explanation:
        - `absolute`: Positions the overlay relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (the root container).
        - `inset-0`: Stretches the overlay to cover the entire parent container.
        - `bg-black bg-opacity-0`: Adds a black background with 0% opacity (can be adjusted to darken the background image).
        - This overlay can be used to dim the background image and make the content more readable.

          Explanation:

/* 
  Summary of the File's Purpose:
  This file defines a reusable layout component (`ShoppingLayout`) for a shopping application. Its primary purpose is to provide a consistent structure across all pages of the application. Here's what it does:

  1. **Background Design**:
     - The layout includes a background image (`bg-bg-image`) that covers the entire screen and is centered. A dark overlay (`bg-black bg-opacity-0`) is added on top of the background image to enhance readability and visual appeal.

  2. **Header**:
     - The `ShoppingHeader` component is rendered at the top of the layout. It typically contains navigation links, a logo, and other header-related elements.

  3. **Main Content Area**:
     - The `Outlet` component is used to render the content of the current route. This allows the layout to dynamically display different pages while maintaining a consistent header and footer.

  4. **Footer**:
     - The `Footer` component is rendered at the bottom of the layout. It typically contains copyright information, links, and other footer-related elements.

  5. **Styling and Structure**:
     - The layout uses Tailwind CSS for styling, ensuring a responsive and visually appealing design. The `relative` and `z-10` classes ensure proper layering of elements, with the content appearing above the overlay.

  By encapsulating the header, footer, and main content area in this layout, the application achieves a consistent and professional look across all pages.
